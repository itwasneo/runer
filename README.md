Why would you need compose if you have rust?

# Motivation

Like every other project, this project was born out of personal need. While I 
was working on one of my personal projects I realized how cumbersome my 
workflow with docker-compose is and decided to write my own "composer".

# Disclaimer

This is not an attempt to create neither the next Ansible nor the next K8s :).
I just wanted to create a fun, easy-to-use tool that I know every aspect of it
and I can use in my **local** development environment.
